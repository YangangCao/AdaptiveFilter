===============================================
Adaptive_filtering_toolbox_v4 (January 9, 2012)
===============================================
General: 
   Modifications in IIR_Adaptive_Filters directory.

Upgrades:
- Correction in ErrorEquation.m;
- Two new examples were added: 
  * example_systemID_ErrorEquation2.m and; 
  * example_systemID_Steiglitz_McBride2.m;
- The error used at the updating process of Steiglitz McBride algorithm was changed 
considering an approximation that yields better results (in terms of bias): 
$e_s(k) \approx e(k)$.



===============================================
Adaptive_filtering_toolbox_v3 (January 6, 2011)
===============================================
General:
   In this version of the toolbox the user will find almost all the functions presented 
in the book "Adaptive Filtering: Algorithms and Practical Implementation", 3rd. edition, 
Springer, whose author is Paulo S.R. Diniz. 
   The Adaptive_filtering_toolbox_v3 is comprised of 82 MATLAB scripts and 1 '.mat' file
corresponding to both adaptive filtering algorithms and scripts that provide examples of 
how to use the algorithms.

Upgrades:
- Encoding of all .m files was changed to Unicode UTF-8.
- Some corrections in the HELP of some functions (e.g.: RLS).
- Revision of some functions:
  . LMS-based algorithms; 
  . RLS algorithms;
  . Set-membership algorithms. 
- New functions: 
  . Lattice-based RLS algorithms; 
  . Fast transversal RLS algorithms; 
  . QR-decomposition-based RLS algorithms;
  . Adaptive IIR Filters;
  . Nonlinear Adaptive Filtering*;
  . Subband Adaptive Filters*;
  . Blind Adaptive Filtering.
* These are the only functions that do not follow the prototype used for most of the functions, 
see readme_toolbox. This is mainly because of the simulation time.



=================================================
Adaptive_filtering_toolbox_v2 (September 3, 2009)
=================================================
- Correction to the script "example_systemID_Dual_sign.m": (thanks to Professor Marcelo Ventura)
 It was calling the "Sign_error" function instead of calling the "Dual_sign" one.



=============================
Adaptive_filtering_toolbox_v1
=============================
- Provided all the adaptive filtering algorithms presented in chapters 1 to 6 of [1].
